Preamble  

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.  
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender them. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software or modify it.
